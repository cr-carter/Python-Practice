<h1>Python</h1>
<h2>The purpose of this repository is to highlight my practice using Python.</h2>

  <p>I started this repository by taking the course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy. The code for this course can be seen in <a href="https://github.com/cr-carter/Python-Practice/tree/main/Complete%20Python%20Bootcamp">this folder</a>.</p>
  <p>I also will be placing any other projects I create in additional folders, such as the <a href="https://github.com/cr-carter/Python-Practice/tree/main/Social%20Media%20Bot">Social Media Bot</a>.</p>
